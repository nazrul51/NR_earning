    <h3>2.Housefull 3</h3>
    <p>Don't come with too high expectations. Remember its a Bollywood comedy movie, you might see some trite moments. So seat back, relax and sure you'll laugh. Everyone delivered what best they could do based on the story-line. Akki with split personality was very good. Ritesh was wonderful. AB was nice too. Boman, no question about it. Girls, I would say only Jacqueline was looking mesmerizing and convincing in her role. Other girls were so so. Jackie had a nice and short stint but played well his part. Couple of good numbers. Nice photography and choreography.</p>

    <h3>3.Housefull 4</h3>
    <p>Film is only about money making in India, respect for Art is dead. No script, no acting, only big stars and plenty of crap songs that's what make movies in India.There should be a quality check before a movie is made public. Outside world when they see this kind of movie they might be laughing at us not on the movie. Directors and Producers of this movie should arrested for making this movie. Its pure nonsense and may cause migraine to some people in audience.</p>

        South movies 🍿 💜 🎞 🎥 
        
        There is something about South Indian movies that touch directly right in the middle of the ♥️ The content they give is so so relatable especially how they portray human emotions like mother son emotion in kgf every person dream of doing something big that’s how we relate I liked JR ntr in This one a lot especially that song by him goosebumps Rajamouli is phenomenal m looking forward to watch his up coming movies but on other side Sad to see our directors like PuriJagannadh losing their hard earned money and properties with films like Acharya and Liger. Time for them to stick to direction like the way Rajamouli does want to see Rajamouli and Rajnikant doing a movie together that would be some blast and also Yash from kgf and Kangana Ranaut from Bollywood together directed by him Netflix has tasted unprecedented success with RRR imagine a series like GameOfThrones conceived by Rajamouli Would be a huge project. Rajamouli is already a global name with RRR This movie is a jewel in Rajamouli ‘s crown and one of the best production by IndiThe two leads Ram and JuniorNTR are actors par excellence! Hope this movie wins all the awards it deserves,,..Personally My three favorite directors in India on larger cinematic experience level are
        
        Prashant Neel 💜 
        Rajamouli 💜 
        Sanjay Leela Bhansali 💜 
        
        Even though I didn’t like the ending I felt ending is too dramatic having Indian gods avatar in the frame but after it got international applaud got it to celebrate the culture globally they might have done it I am surprised to see google has honoured this 🎥 by giving special motion emoticon wow 😮 🤩 truly deserving ♥️ 
        
        Jr NTR the emotions you showed in the song komuram bheemudo is phenomenal spellbound act.
        
        10/10
        
        Must watch 👵 👨 👩
        
        An ultimate BROMANCE movie 😎 🤩
        
        The Music, score, cinematography yesss everything deserves an Oscar!,.,,,,,let’s come to technicalities There is a reason why the animals cgi although average looks good because NTR draws the eyes towards him, he acts in such a way that the jagged edges of the cgi animals get ignored and he brings in a sense of realism to them with his perfect acting,,,this movie achieved everything. Now the only one left is Awards. We are aiming for the biggest one🤞
        
        This is first Indian movie for which westerners are going GaGa over truly truly deserving the buzz comes true and JrNTR is indeed nominated for the Best Actor Oscar Award, he'll become the first Indian actor to ever receive the honour 🤴 👑 🤴</p>
